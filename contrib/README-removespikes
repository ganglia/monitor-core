README for removespikes.pl

Skript to remove spikes from RRD databases. Distributed with
permission from Tobias Oetiker ( tobi _AT_ oetiker.ch ). The original
download place is at: http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/contrib/

This version of removespikes.pl is based on Vins Vilaplana and
Humberto Rossetti Baptistas code.

I have added value-based chopping (-t value), an analysis-only mode (-a),
control of verbose/debug output (-d/-v), a help option (-h) and some
code cleanup.

removespikes>./removespikes.pl -h
REMOVESPIKES: Remove spikes from RRDtool databases.

Usage:
./removespikes.pl -d -a [-l number] [-t maxval] name_of_database

Where:
  -d enables debug messages
  -a runs only the analysis phase of the script
  -h prints this message
  -l sets the % limit of spikes bin-based chopping (default: 0.6)
  -t sets the value above which records are chopped. Disabled by default.
     Enabling value-based chopping will disable bin-based chopping

  -v Verbose mode. Shows some information
  name_of_database is the rrd file to be treated.
