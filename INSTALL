Installation Instructions
*************************

Dependencies
============

* APR (http://apr.apache.org/)
* libConfuse (http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/)
* expat (http://expat.sourceforge.net/)
* python (http://www.python.org/)
* PCRE (http://www.pcre.org/)
* RRDtool (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/)

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.

The use of a GNU build chain (Make and C compiler) is encouraged but not
compulsory.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC="gcc -std=gnu99" CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix

Optional Features
=================

support for python as a metric scripting language is optional and could be
disabled by using :

  --disable-python

the PCRE dependency is only needed to allow for the use of templates to
define metric names using "name_match" in gmond.conf and could be disabled
by using :

  --without-libpcre

gmetad is only needed to be able to generate reports and summary of the metric
data collected and so will only be built if explicitally requested with :

  --with-gmetad

for more details in some of the flags available refer to the README and the
ouput of :

  ./configure --help
