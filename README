This is an attempt to make the Ganglia UI more usable. You should be able to drop this into
your $HTTPD_ROOT/ganglia then run make to generate conf.php.

Please modify Makefile to point the directory where you installed the code. Also note
that Makefile will create directories /var/lib/ganglia/rrds and /var/lib/ganglia/dwoo
which are required for UI to function.

New features
============

Views
=====

Views are an arbitrary collection of hostname/metric graphs. They are defined using JSON files and stored in the
/conf directory. View file names have to start with view ie.

view_web_servers_vitals.json

There are two types of views, standard (default) and regex views. 

Standard views are defined as follows

{"view_name":"web_servers_vitals",
  "items": [
    { "hostname":"web1", "metric":"disk_free"},
    { "hostname":"web2", "graph":"cpu_report"}
          ]
}

Regex views allow using regex to match hostnames (need to specify view_type regex) e.g.

{"view_name":"web_servers_wiki",
 "view_type":"regex",
  "items": [
    { "hostname":"web-wiki.*", "metric":"disk_free"},
    { "hostname":".*wiki", "graph":"cpu_report"}
          ]
}

Obviously you can write a regex that matches a single host. 

Easy Graph Aggregation
======================

You can also define add graphs created through easy graph aggregation by specifying
"aggregate_graph": true then specifying all the regex rules to match host_regexes.
For example this is one example. Save it as view_myview.json and put in the conf 
directory.

{
 "view_name":"myview",
 "items":[
  { "hostname":"web01.domain.com","graph":"cpu_report"},
  { "aggregate_graph":"true",
      "host_regex":[ 
        {"regex":"web-0[1-6]"},
        {"regex":"web-2[3-6]"}
      ],
      "metric":"load_one",
      "graph_type":"line",
      "description":"Prod Web Servers load1"
  }
 ],
 "view_type":"standard"
}


Auto Rotation
=============

Automatically rotate view graphs every 30 seconds with hour, day, week and month overview for each metric
on a single page. It will rotate until page closed. 

Optional Graphs
===============

Ability to define optional graphs that are show at the top of the page for any host.
Those are defined using overrides stored in $GANGLIA_DIR/conf directory. You need
to make sure that directory is writeable by the Apache/Web user.

This should work like the normal Ganglia web UI. The difference is that
you need to make the conf/ directory writeable by the Apache user.

Search
======

You can search for a metric or a host in a live manner. You should be able to click on the
host or metric in the search and 

Installation notes
==================

IMPORTANT:
You will need PHP JSON extension. It comes with PHP 5.2+. If you are on 5.1
use 

pecl install json

pecl is part of php-pear package on RHEL/CentOS. Make sure you have 

# cat /etc/php.d/json.ini 
extension=json.so

On RHEL/CentOS 4, you will also need phpize which comes with the php-devel package.

BUGS
====

In the search window when you click on a metric it should actually jump to the metric once the
page is opened. That doesn't work. If you just press enter in the Location bar it does jump.
