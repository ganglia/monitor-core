You will need python-rrdtool to run this.

Run in this order:

rrdcreate.py, to create the database.

rrdupdate.py <ip> <port>, to update the database.
The ip and port are the ones for Gmetad's internal metrics daemon.
Updating it at regular intervals can be done by using this command:
./autoupdate.sh <ip> <port>
or any other way you want!

rrdgraphs.py, to draw the graphs in a .png file.

You can also use the html page to view them too, but they will not be "live" graphs.
